Because my English not too well, there will have some gramma mistakes or any word mistake is normal.
All calculate were after recalculated because to prevent some calculate errors(rounded decimal) but if it less than three decimal, it will use it, and won't recalculate.
Decimal, if it is repeatly decimal, it will round down at least two(e.g. 2.2222 >> 2.22 / 2.312222 >> 2.3122), if it is long decimal, it will at least show 3, not below 2, if I haven't mistakes.
All rank is follow by the origanal faclist, if I haven't any mistakes.
The faclist format is follow by that list too.
I am not sure it won't have any error and mistakes but the profit is used to referring, all profit and prices is change by region, techs and policies.
All assets prices is follow to IdleCorp Wiki(I have checked, that all are sell prices so if you want to know the buy prices, just 2 times of the sell price, and I won't change any prices in Profit.txt to buy price(include of jet fuel price)).
In Profit.txt, the consumes haven't sum together, if you want to know te total consumes, you sum it together by yourself.
Maybe will have some miss so don't need to supprise.
All numbers won't show as fractions.
You still need to follow to the actual region production modifiers to change.
Hope You will understand how to look Profit.txt

Profit.txt Format
follow to origanal faclist, with the following format:
```
Profit
<profit>(Produces-Consumes)(pre second)
<the at least factorys(of First Fac) can handle(ratio)>(used to refer)(the ratio of orginal ratio is 1:1 and not really is 1:1 now will show all fac ratio like 1:1:1 or 1:4:1, the ratio of the left of the rightest number is arrange of faclist(mean the consumes list))
First Fac(just the first builded factory)
<all facilities need>(when in 100% speed)
<total lands need>
<profit/land used>(pre land)
--
<by-products>(pre second)(if it have by-product(s))
--
<by-products profit>(pre second)(if it have by-product(s))
--
(Haven't the total profit and total by-products' profit, if you want it, calculate it by yourself)
```
